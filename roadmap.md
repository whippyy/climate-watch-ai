# üåç Climate Watch AI ‚Äì Project Roadmap (10 hrs/week, ~5 weeks)

---

## ‚úÖ Week 1: Data Collection & Exploration

- Ingest historical wildfire and weather datasets (NASA, NOAA, USGS)
- Clean and preprocess datasets for modeling
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter notebooks
- Save cleaned data for modeling

---

## ‚úÖ Week 2: Model Development & Backend API

- Train a baseline wildfire risk prediction model (XGBoost or Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance on test data
- Develop backend API using FastAPI with a `/predict-risk` endpoint
- Test API locally with sample inputs

---

## ‚úÖ Week 3: Frontend Dashboard MVP

- Build a simple React frontend with map visualization (Mapbox or Leaflet)
- Display wildfire risk predictions on the map
- Add basic charts to visualize fire trends
- Connect frontend to backend API

---

## ‚úÖ Week 4: Deployment & Documentation

- Deploy backend API on Render or AWS
- Deploy frontend on Netlify or Vercel
- Write and polish README and project documentation
- (Optional) Prepare a basic insights report/notebook summarizing findings

---

## üîÆ Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)

- Integrate live weather API for real-time data
- Add interactivity like timeline slider for risk over time
- Enable user data upload for custom predictions
- Implement push notifications or alerts
